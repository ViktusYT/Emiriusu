# Emiriusu Engine
The Emiriusu Engine is an old school Windows and Linux 2D game engine for strategic games written in C++ with SFML libraries. The Engine (and the example game we are making) will provides displaying graphics and animations, generating a random world, playing music and sounds, old school interface, many typical strategic mechanics, Artificial intelligence and online multiplayer.

We are constantly adding new features to the engine and patching up bugs. The engine an the game will be available for free.
